# Roadmap

## Done

- OJS plugin (`wpojs-subscription-api`) — code complete, reviewed
- WP plugin (`wpojs-sync`) — code complete, reviewed
- Docker dev environment
- Member dashboard widget (WooCommerce My Account)
- UI messages (OJS login hint, paywall hint, footer)
- Non-Docker setup guide — `docs/non-docker-setup.md`
- Dev environment clean rebuild verified — all 61 e2e tests passing
- Staging VPS on Hetzner (Michal's org account) — fully scripted, smoke tests (22/22) + load tests passing, bulk sync 684/684 clean
- Deployment automation — `init-vps.sh`, `deploy.sh`, `provision-vps.sh`, `smoke-test.sh`, `load-test.sh`
- Deployment docs — `docs/vps-deployment.md` (public), `docs/private/staging-prod-setup.md` (private)
- Security hardening — no default passwords (fail-loud), env var validation in deploy.sh, .env permissions handling
- Smoke tests cover admin pages (WP + OJS) to catch .env/permission issues that WP-CLI misses
- HPOS fix for sample data seeding (disable → seed → sync → re-enable)
- Three-phase rollout plan — `docs/private/pre-production-checklist.md`
- Live WP plugin audit — `data export/live-wp-plugin-audit.md` (35 plugins, theme identified)
- Password hash sync (bulk, new members, ongoing password changes) — WP hashes sent to OJS, members log in with existing WP password, lazy rehash to cost 12 on first OJS login
- Dev-vs-live branding parity — journal metadata, theme, nav menu, editorial team, sidebar blocks (Information + event banners), "For Advertisers" static page + sidebar link

## Blocked — waiting on access

- [x] ~~**Hetzner Cloud account for SEA**~~ — Done. Using Michal's org account (`sea-michal`).
- [x] ~~**Krystal WP SSH access**~~ — Working (`sea-wp-live`, port 722).
- [x] ~~**OJS branding/theme**~~ — Fully replicated in `setup-ojs.sh` (config-as-code). No SSH to PKP-hosted live OJS needed.

## Next: OJS live on Hetzner

Server: `sea-live` (was `sea-staging`, promoted 2026-03-19). SSH: `ssh sea-live`. Deploy: `scripts/deploy.sh --host=sea-live --ssl --env-file=.env.live`.

- [x] ~~Set up SEA Hetzner VPS~~ — `scripts/init-vps.sh`, deployed and verified 2026-03-10
- [x] ~~Deploy OJS + WP~~ — 68 issues imported, 22/22 smoke tests pass
- [x] ~~DNS cutover~~ — `journal.existentialanalysis.org.uk` → `46.225.173.209` (2026-03-19, via cPanel UAPI)
- [x] ~~Caddy + firewall~~ — ports 80/443 open, Caddy deployed with `--ssl`, auto-provisioning Let's Encrypt cert
- [x] ~~SSL cert provisioned~~ — HTTPS working, Caddy auto-provisioned Let's Encrypt cert (verified 2026-03-19)
- [x] ~~Resend email~~ — SMTP + SPF/DKIM working (confirmed 2026-03-19)
- [ ] Monitor 24-48h
- [x] ~~Decommission PKP hosting~~ — cancelled, runs until ~September 2026

## WP sync (Phase 2) — LIVE

WP (`community.existentialanalysis.org.uk` on Krystal) ↔ OJS (`journal.existentialanalysis.org.uk` on Hetzner).

### OJS-side prep — DONE

- [x] ~~`config.inc.php` `[wpojs]` section~~ — `api_key_secret`, `allowed_ips` (77.72.2.79 Krystal + 172.0.0.0/8 Docker), `wp_member_url`, `support_email`
- [x] ~~Subscription type created~~ — "Membership (all tiers)" (type_id=1, £0)
- [x] ~~OJS ping reachable from Krystal~~ — verified

### WP-side deployment — DONE

- [x] ~~Plugin uploaded and activated~~ — `wpojs-sync` active on Krystal WP
- [x] ~~API key in wp-config.php~~ — `WPOJS_API_KEY=QDGwNVJpIQDjvQ8U3dCIMSLrCef57YLA`
- [x] ~~OJS Base URL configured~~ — `https://journal.existentialanalysis.org.uk/index.php/ea`
- [x] ~~Product mappings~~ — all 6 products → OJS type 1:
    | WC Product ID | Product name | OJS Type ID |
    |---|---|---|
    | 1892 | UK Membership (no directory listing) | 1 |
    | 1924 | International Membership (no directory listing) | 1 |
    | 1927 | Student Membership (no directory listing) | 1 |
    | 23040 | Student Membership (with directory listing) | 1 |
    | 23041 | International Membership (with directory listing) | 1 |
    | 23042 | UK Membership (with directory listing) | 1 |

### Bulk sync — DONE (2026-03-20)

- [x] ~~Dry run~~ — 677 members, 0 failures
- [x] ~~Bulk sync~~ — 677 synced, 0 skipped, 0 failed (226s, adaptive throttle)
- [x] ~~3 pre-sync failures retried~~ — events that fired before type mappings were configured
- [x] ~~Post-sync smoke test~~ — 22/22 passed
- OJS: 1370 users, 1366 subscriptions (includes 692 from March 19 test sync + 678 from March 20 production sync)

### Post-launch — IN PROGRESS

- [x] ~~Spot-check 2-3 members can log into OJS with WP password~~ — 2 members tested successfully (2026-03-21)
- [ ] Test new member flow (create WCS subscription → verify OJS access created)
- [ ] Test cancellation flow (cancel → verify OJS access removed)
- [ ] Test on-hold / failed payment scenario
- [ ] **Mobile testing** — check OJS article pages, archive, login, inline HTML galley, paywall on mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Android Chrome). Check responsive layout, readability, touch targets, galley content overflow.
- [ ] **Non-member purchase flow** — two options to test:
  - **Option A: PayPal** — credentials needed from Emi (business account email + REST API client ID + secret from https://developer.paypal.com/dashboard/applications/live). Add to `.env.live`: `OJS_PAYPAL_ACCOUNT`, `OJS_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID`, `OJS_PAYPAL_SECRET`, `OJS_PAYPAL_TEST_MODE=0`. Deploy. Can't test on localhost (PayPal needs callbacks). Sandbox may decline GBP from US sandbox accounts.
  - **Option B: Manual Payment plugin** — OJS built-in, no third-party credentials. Admin manually marks payments as received. Good enough for low-volume non-member purchases while PayPal creds are pending. Test this workflow first.
- [x] ~~Monitor 24-48h — check sync log for failures~~ — 0 sync failures, 678/678 reconciliation clean (2026-03-21)
- [x] ~~Run `wp ojs-sync reconcile` manually after 24h to check for drift~~ — 678 OK, 0 drift (2026-03-21)
- [x] ~~Investigate "Active WP members: 0" in `wp ojs-sync status`~~ — fixed, now shows 678 correctly

### Hardening — TODO

- [ ] **ggshield** — installed (v1.48.0) but needs verification: check pre-commit integration, VS Code extension working, test with a dummy secret
- [ ] **DOI deposits: switch off test mode** — all 1,470 DOIs deposited in test mode (2026-03-21). Queue fully drained (blast-queue.sh). Current status: 883 SUBMITTED (test accepted), 581 ERROR (test rejected), 8 UNREGISTERED. None are registered in production — test mode deposits don't count. Steps to go live:
  1. Identify the 38 pre-existing DOIs (36.2 + 37.1) — these are **already registered on Crossref** with old PKP-hosted URLs
  2. Mark pre-existing DOIs as STALE: `UPDATE dois SET status = 5 WHERE doi LIKE '10.%' AND doi_id IN (SELECT doi_id FROM ...);` (STALE = registered but needs re-deposit to update URL)
  3. Mark all remaining DOIs as UNREGISTERED: `UPDATE dois SET status = 1 WHERE status != 5;` (SUBMITTED/ERROR from test mode are meaningless — test deposits don't register)
  4. Flip Crossref plugin from test mode to production: `UPDATE plugin_settings SET setting_value='0' WHERE plugin_name='crossrefplugin' AND setting_name='testMode';`
  5. Queue all deposits: trigger via OJS admin DOI management page (select all → deposit)
  6. Run `blast-queue.sh --host=sea-live --workers=3` to drain
  7. Verify on Crossref: check a few DOIs resolve to `journal.existentialanalysis.org.uk` (both new and pre-existing)
- [ ] **SMTP credentials audit** — Resend API key in `.env.live` (gitignored). Docs only have placeholder `re_your_api_key_here`. Git history is clean (no real keys). Consider rotating the Resend key anyway as a precaution.
- [ ] **Env var hardening deployed** — committed (aeb04c3) but not yet deployed to live. Next deploy will pick it up automatically.

## Later: WP migration to Hetzner (Phase 3)

Move WP from Krystal to Hetzner. Both WP + OJS on same VPS.

- [ ] Integrate SEAcomm/Helium theme (pull from Krystal via SSH)
- [ ] Add live plugins to `composer.json` (Gantry 5, Wordfence, Enhancer for WCS, others TBD)
- [ ] Stripe test mode configured
- [ ] Database + uploads migrated from Krystal
- [ ] `wp search-replace` for domain
- [ ] DNS cutover for `community.existentialanalysis.org.uk`
- [ ] Update OJS allowed_ips (now Docker network)
- [ ] Cancel Krystal hosting

## Live WP environment (community.existentialanalysis.org.uk)

Investigated 2026-03-19. The membership site is on Krystal at `~/community.existentialanalysis.org.uk/` (NOT `~/public_html/`, which is a separate brochure site). SSH: `sea-wp-live` (port 722, user `existent`).

- **WP 6.9.4**, **PHP 8.3.30** — exceeds plugin requirements
- **WooCommerce** 10.6.1, **WCS** 8.5.0, **Ultimate Member** 2.11.2, **Stripe** 10.5.2, **Action Scheduler** (bundled, running)
- **1,419 users**, 12 admins, **699 active subscriptions** with 6 membership products
- **6 subscription products** (all annual): UK £50, International £60, Student £35 — each in "with listing" and "no listing" variants
- **9 UM roles** including 3 manual Exco/life member roles (1 user total)
- **Wordfence** active — check outbound rules before connecting to OJS
- **`proc_open` disabled** — `wp db query` won't work, use `wp eval` with `$wpdb` instead. Does not affect sync plugin.
- **WP cron** via page loads (no system cron for WP). Action Scheduler runs every minute.
- Plugin dir writable, no existing `WPOJS_API_KEY` in wp-config.php
- **HPOS disabled** — subscriptions in `wp_posts`, not `wc_orders`. Sync plugin handles both. Don't enable on Krystal; enable at Phase 3 (WP→Hetzner).

## DNS management

Nameservers are Krystal's (`ns1.krystal.uk`, `ns2.krystal.uk`). All DNS for `existentialanalysis.org.uk` is managed via cPanel on the Krystal account — no registrar or third-party access needed.

**Backup:** `docs/private/dns-backup-2026-03-19.txt` — full zone snapshot before changes.

**Read zone:** `ssh sea-wp-live "uapi DNS parse_zone zone=existentialanalysis.org.uk"`

**Update A record** (two-step: get serial, then edit):
```bash
# 1. Get current serial from parse_zone SOA record
ssh sea-wp-live "uapi DNS parse_zone zone=existentialanalysis.org.uk --output=json" | python3 -c "..."
# 2. Edit with matching serial and line_index
ssh sea-wp-live 'uapi DNS mass_edit_zone zone=existentialanalysis.org.uk serial=<SERIAL> edit="{\"line_index\":<LINE>,\"dname\":\"journal\",\"record_type\":\"A\",\"data\":[\"<IP>\"],\"ttl\":300}"'
```
Get `<LINE>` from `parse_zone` output (`line_index` field). Get `<SERIAL>` from SOA record.

**Current records of interest:**
| Subdomain | Type | Value | What |
|---|---|---|---|
| `journal` | A | `46.225.173.209` | Hetzner staging OJS (changed 2026-03-19) |
| `community` | A | `77.72.2.79` | Krystal WP (membership site) |
| (root) | A | `77.72.2.79` | Krystal WP (brochure site) |

## Dev environment rebuild + verify

Full dev rebuild is a two-step process:

1. **Rebuild + sample data** (~3–5 min): `scripts/rebuild-dev.sh --with-sample-data --skip-tests`
   Seeds ~1400 test WP users + subscriptions and 2 sample OJS issues. Includes branding, plugin config, subscription types.
2. **Full backfill import** (~15 min): `backfill/import.sh backfill/output/* --clean`
   Imports all 68 issues (1398 articles, HTML + PDF galleys, 469MB XML). `--clean` wipes DB first. For single-issue updates: `import.sh backfill/output/37.1 --force` (overwrites that issue only).
3. **Run e2e tests**: `npx playwright test` — 66 tests, all should pass.
4. **Verify banner links**: sidebar "BOOK NOW" banners should link to `WPOJS_WP_MEMBER_URL` (not localhost).

Last verified 2026-03-19:
- [x] Dev containers running, test-connection passes
- [x] 66/66 Playwright e2e tests pass (inline HTML galley TOC test fixed — was incorrectly checking paywalled articles' Full Text links)

## Future staging rebuild

When a staging server is needed for testing changes before live:

1. `scripts/init-vps.sh --name=sea-staging`
2. `scripts/deploy.sh --host=sea-staging --provision --env-file=.env.staging`
3. `scripts/backfill-remote.sh --host=sea-staging` — syncs + imports all 68 issues
4. `scripts/smoke-test.sh --host=sea-staging`

No staging server currently exists. Live is `sea-live`.

## Staging test results (2026-03-10, sea-michal account)

- [x] Connection test passes
- [x] Bulk sync — 684/684 members synced to OJS (50s, 0 failures)

- [x] Manual roles, settings behaviour, WP-CLI commands, API auth
- [x] Inline HTML galley — editorial inline content, hidden "Full Text" links, PDF visible, paywall excluded

## Backfill: journal archive (30 years of back-issues)

All 68 issue PDFs (Vol 1–37.1) collected, verified, and in `backfill/input/`. See `docs/backfill-issue-inventory.md` for full inventory with page counts, TOC status, and article counts.

### Done

- [x] Audit all source PDFs (`backfill/audit.py`)
- [x] OCR 6 scanned PDFs (6.1, 13.1, 13.2, 14.1, 14.2, 29.2)
- [x] Manual TOC sidecars for 5 unparseable issues (2, 6.1, 6.2, 16.1, 16.2)
- [x] Download live WP archive (`securepdfs/`), compare all three sources
- [x] Fix mislabelled PDFs: 34.1 and 35.1 (archive had wrong issue content)
- [x] Replace truncated 6.2 (22pp) with full 204-page version from live server
- [x] Obtain missing PDFs: 34.1, 35.1, 36.2 (from live WP), 37.1 (provided manually)
- [x] Rebuild 6.2.toc.json for full 204-page issue
- [x] Human review of all prepared PDFs
- [x] Pivot: delete automated TOC parser, adopt Claude-reviewed toc.json as primary
- [x] All 68 toc.json files created and verified (1398 articles/reviews)
- [x] Phase 1: Add ~60 missing book review entries across 16 early issues (vols 2–17.1)
- [x] Phase 2: Fix PAGE_OFF_BY_1 (~120 entries), page range bugs, honorifics, gaps, missing entries
- [x] Full verification pass (7 agents across all 68 volumes) — all findings resolved
- [x] Data quality clean: zero honorifics, zero malformed metadata, all book_years filled
- [x] Google Sheet published (1398 rows): `backfill/sheets_export.py`
- [x] Enrichment data imported from spreadsheet review (`backfill/import_review.py`)
- [x] Automated toc.json audit tool (`backfill/audit_toc.py`) — checks page boundaries, back matter, reviewer attribution, book review metadata against source PDFs
- [x] Back matter removal — 60+ pages of ISSN, Publications Received, ads, membership forms, contributor guidelines removed from last articles across 40+ volumes
- [x] 105 articles extended to include missing last page (author bios, references, final paragraphs)
- [x] 91 book reviews extended to include reviewer byline page
- [x] 19 wrong reviewer attributions corrected (article authors misassigned as reviewers)
- [x] 7 combined multi-book reviews fixed (identical page ranges for all entries)
- [x] 3 missing articles/reviews added (Vol 7.1 Jennifer Hay, Vol 11.2 Milton letter, Vol 31.2 Living Your Own Life)
- [x] Vol 6.1 all 7 book review page ranges corrected (shifted ~3 pages)
- [x] Vol 18.2 Zone of Interior split into 3 separate reviews (Rosemary Moore, Joseph Berke, M. Guy Thompson)
- [x] Vol 30.2 Happy City split into 3 entries (Happy City review, A Ghost Story film review, Cotterrell exhibition report)
- [x] Systematic back matter scan — 20+ entries trimmed across 17 volumes (Publications Received, Advertising Rates, Back Issues pages incorrectly included)
- [x] `audit_toc.py` enhanced: checks ALL articles for back matter flags (not just last), auto-fix mode for both last-article and mid-issue back matter
- [x] HTML bleed detection + trimming tool (`backfill/fix_html_bleed.py`) with running header stripping
- [x] Separate Haiku prompts per section type (article, shared-page article, book review) with book_title disambiguation

### Next

- [x] **HTML galley regeneration** — all 1398 articles have HTML galleys. 42 PyMuPDF fallback (content-filtered). Report: `backfill/output/htmlgen-report.json`.
- [x] **HTML galley QA & consistency pass** — `audit_html.py` + `fix_html_bleed.py` enhancements. Fixed 168 issues (running headers, reviewer mismatches, missing bylines, page boundaries). Broader spot-check (109 reviews across 41 volumes): 89/109 pass (82%), then fixed all 20 failures (truncations, merged reviews, wrong reviewers). Final audit: 1398 files, 0 issues.
- [x] **Archive quality notice** — subtle footer box on all OJS pages: "Our archive has been digitally restored from 30 years of print issues. If you spot any errors or formatting issues, please let us know at [email]." Contact email configurable via `OJS_CONTACT_EMAIL`.
- [x] **Fix duplicate abstracts** — article pages showed abstract twice (once in OJS metadata, once in HTML galley). Phase 1: updated 312 toc.json abstracts + 103 keywords from cleaner HTML galley text, fixed 24 bad keyword arrays. Phase 2: stripped abstract sections from all 520 HTML galley files. Scripts: `backfill/update_abstracts.py`, `backfill/strip_abstract.py`. Deployed to live 2026-03-21.
- [x] ~~**Broader shared-page book review check**~~ — 268 shared-page reviews checked, 3 bleed cases fixed (14.2, 32.2×2), 7 false positives confirmed. 0 remaining (2026-03-21).

## Future improvements

- [x] **Inline HTML galley plugin** — standalone OJS plugin (`inlineHtmlGalley`) renders HTML galley content inline on article pages for users with access. Hides all galley links (PDF, HTML, Full Text) on issue TOC / archive pages so readers click through to the article landing page. On article pages, hides "Full Text" link when inline content is shown; PDF link remains visible. 5 Playwright tests.
- [ ] **Cross-issue browsing** — let readers browse articles by type (e.g., Book Reviews) across issue boundaries. Two things to investigate:
  - [ ] **Browse by Section plugin** (`pkp/browseBySection`) — install from Plugin Gallery, enable per-section. Works with existing section assignments, no extra metadata. Easiest win.
  - [ ] **OJS categories** — decide taxonomy/topology (hierarchical, one level of nesting supported). Categories are independent of sections and require assigning articles (could be done during backfill import). Decide what categories to create and whether they add value beyond section browsing.
- [ ] **Non-member payment UX flow** — registration now enabled (`disableUserReg=0`). OJS redirects anonymous users to login when they click a paywalled article, with no "this is paywalled / subscribe / purchase" interstitial. Just a bare login form. This is how the OJS code works (`Validation::redirectLogin()` in `ArticleHandler.php` fires for anonymous users on restricted galleys; purchase flow requires `$user->getId()`). Need to test the full non-member flow (register → login → purchase) and work out whether the UX is acceptable or needs a custom interstitial.
- [ ] Admin per-member sync status — Sync Log page shows global stats but no per-user view. Data exists in `wp_wpojs_sync_log` + `_wpojs_user_id` usermeta; just needs a UI.
- [ ] **ORCID integration** — configure ORCID plugin, add ORCID iDs to author metadata where available. OJS has a built-in ORCID plugin (Plugin Gallery). Needs: ORCID Member API credentials (or Public API for display-only), then either manual entry per author or bulk lookup/import.
- [x] ~~**DOI assignment**~~ — All 1,470 DOIs assigned (1,402 articles + 68 issues). 38 pre-existing Crossref DOIs (36.2 + 37.1) marked STALE (need re-deposit to update URL). Remaining 1,432 UNREGISTERED. `doi-registry.json` exported from live DB for repave resilience. `doiCreationTime=publication` on production, `never` on dev/staging. Author guidelines updated with DOI-in-references requirement.
- [x] ~~**DOI deposit to Crossref**~~ — all 1,470 DOIs deposited in test mode (2026-03-21). Queue fully drained via `blast-queue.sh` (834 jobs, 146 stuck/reserved, cleared and re-drained). Production deposit pending — see Hardening section.
- [ ] **Crossref reference linking** — Crossref membership obligation: include DOIs for cited works when depositing ([reference linking docs](https://www.crossref.org/documentation/reference-linking/)). Current Crossref Reference Linking Plugin (`pkp/crossrefReferenceLinking`) is broken on OJS 3.5. OJS 3.6 will integrate citation linking properly ([pkp/pkp-lib#12104](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues/12104)). Author guidelines already updated on submissions page to request DOIs in references. 18-month grace period for new members.
  - [ ] **Phase 1: Extract archive citations from HTML galleys** — parse reference sections from existing HTML galleys (~1,356 articles), split into individual citations, load into OJS `citations` table. Structures the data properly regardless of DOI availability.
  - [ ] **Phase 2: Look up DOIs for existing citations** — use Crossref REST API to match extracted citations to DOIs (free, no per-lookup cost). Crossref provides reference matching tools for this. Most humanities references won't have DOIs, but this catches what's available. When OJS 3.6 lands, the built-in plugin can include matched DOIs in `<citation_list>` deposits automatically.
- [ ] **Analytics** — decide on analytics approach: OJS Usage Statistics plugin (built-in, basic), Google Analytics, Plausible, or Matomo. Consider: privacy (GDPR), what metrics matter (downloads, page views, geographic), cost.
- [ ] **Security audit** — review OJS hardening: file upload restrictions, rate limiting, CSP headers, admin access controls, backup strategy, update policy. Check Caddy security headers. Review WP plugin (API key handling, input validation, CSRF). Penetration test the sync API endpoint.
- [ ] **SEO** — verify OJS metadata for search engines: citation meta tags (Highwire/Dublin Core), sitemap.xml, robots.txt, Open Graph tags, Google Scholar indexing. Check that abstracts, keywords, and author names appear in page source. Submit sitemap to Google Search Console. Consider structured data (schema.org/ScholarlyArticle).

Dropped (not worth the complexity):
- ~~Batch bulk sync endpoint~~ — would reduce 1400 HTTP calls to ~14 but adds OJS-side complexity (transactions, partial failure). Load-based backpressure + adaptive throttling makes sequential sync fast enough (~40s on Hetzner for 684 users).
- ~~Differential reconciliation~~ — full scan batches (chunks of 100). Fast enough.
- ~~API key rotation~~ — ops procedure, not a code feature.
- ~~On-hold grace period~~ — WCS retries failed payments automatically. Revisit if it generates support tickets.
